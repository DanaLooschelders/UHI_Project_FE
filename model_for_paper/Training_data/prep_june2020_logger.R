# Data june_iButtons #
#################
# Two different ways of reading in data:
# 1. Read in a single file: If you only need to control a single june_iButton etc. use this code
# 2. Read in several files that are in the working directory: 
#    If you want to look at multiple june_iButtons, apply statistics to all data etc. use this code

# Create new header as the default one from the files isn't really pretty

# We only need the ID # without the first (empty) column, so we set the first column to NULL in colClasses
